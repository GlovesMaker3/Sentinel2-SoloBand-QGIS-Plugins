about=
	The plugin allows for the retrieval of individual spectral channels from the Sentinel-2 mission at resolutions of 10m and 20m for an area specified in the GeoJSON file. Additionally, it enables the conversion of SHP files to GeoJSON format for added convenience. Through the built-in filter, users can specify a time range and account for cloud cover. It's important to note that the plugin does not download images that are offline. The plugin is continuously evolving.
